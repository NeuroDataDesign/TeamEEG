AUTOMAGIC: Standardized Preprocessing of Big EEG Data

-objectively quantify the quality of preprocessed EEG
-reduce artifact via pipeline of algorithms to detect artifcatual channels + MARA (Multiple Artifact Rejection Algorithm) + ICA (independent component analysis) - based artifcat correction method
-addresses two problems: 
 - artifact correction (improve on what is already currently available)
 - handling of growing studies by keeping track pf already preprocesed datasets
-EEGLAB extension
-three basic sections - project, configuration and quality assessment
-workflow:
 raw data -> bad channel identification and then subsequently remove it -> artifact correction -> interpolation and quality assessment -> preprocessed categorised into Good, Bad or OK
-bad channels are those with low signal to noise ratio, identified using PREP pipeline or EEGLAB plugin clean_rawdata()
-validation was done only on PDS's of resting EEG with eyes open



EEG microstates as a tool for studying the temporal dynamics of whole-brain
neuronal networks: A review

-electrical microstates - sucessive short time periods during which config of the scalp potential field remains semi-stable
-represent basic building blocks of the chain of spontaneous concious mental processes
-microstate analysis:
 EEG -> filtered -> cleaned EEG -> determination of GFP peaks -> clustering of all maps -> determination of optimal clusters -> fitting cluster maps to original EEG by spatial correlation
-microstate model has no constraint on spatial distribution of brain activity, but constrains the activity of all the sources contirbuting to a single microstate to a commone time-course
-microstate time series have a clearly structured temporal organization that is neither random nor predetermined, but cannot be predicted
-approach has been used in cases of dementia, narcolepsy, panic disorder, mulitple sclerosis, head injusry, stroke and diplegia
-possible issues - standardisation of the approach (ie number of microstates to be used and the way to define them), optimal number of clusters should be defined, sources underlying the different microstates
