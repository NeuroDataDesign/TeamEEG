#Microstates in Resting-State EEG: Current Status and Future Directions (Khanna 2015):

  -EEG - millisecond temporal resolution
  
  -Resting state, alpha frequency band (8-12Hz) can be categorized into a limited number of distinct “stable” states called microstates.
  
 - Microstate - topography of electrical potentials from multichannel array of the scalp that last for 80-120 ms before transitioning to a different microstate.
  
  -Global representation of a functional state
  
  -In my own words = many different recurring patterns of activity that is momentarily stable 
  
  -Represent discrete mental operations that combine to create spontaneous mental activity 
  
  -The way you perceive stimuli depends on the current microstate of your brain 
  
  -People think different things in different microstates ex. State for imagery  and state for abstract thought



#Automagic: Standardized preprocessing of big EEG data (Pedroni 2019 Automagic):

  A way to improve the quality of eeg recording and set a standard of quality to allow for large scale adoption of using EEG data
 The main purpose of this is to remove subjective opions on data EEG sets and to create a formal way to find and identify noisy channels and data sets in order to improve overall quiality if analysis of the data
 
 Pipeline -> Data -> Bad Channel Identification -> remove bad channels -> correct artifacts if possible -> Quility assesment and Classification (into 'good' 'ok' and 'bad' data sets)
 
If recorded you can inclde EOG (electroculargraph) and use that data to exclude noise from brain signal for eye movment 
Ratio of Bad Channels (RBC) is calcuted to determine if a data set is 'good' 'ok' or 'bad'

"applying a pipeline of bad channel identification algorithms and MARA, an ICA-based artifact correction method, is sufficient to reduce a large number of artifacts."

Uses EEGLab for some preprossesing features.
