MNE software for processing MEG and EEG data, by: Alexandre Gramfort, Martin Luessi, Eric Larson, Denis A. Engemann, Daniel Strohmeier, Christian Brodbeck, Lauri Parkkonen, Matti S. Hämäläinen; Published in NeuroImage

Notes: (high temporal resolution)
  MEG = Magnetoencephalography
  EEG = electroencephalography

  -MEG and EEG measure weak electromagnetic singals coming from the brain
  
  -MNE is a package created to help analyes MEG and EEG signals and it can do: preprocessing, source estimation, time–frequency analysis, statistical analysis, and several methods to estimate functional connectivity between distributed brain regions.
  
  -*.fif is a file type the stores information using tags
  
  -provides a visual representation of the activity on a sample brain 
  
  -The Python Version provides the most tools: filtering, signal space projection, independent component analysis, coregistration of MEG and MRI, (does not cotain forward modeling), Time-Frequency analysis,(Does Not Contain Dipole Modeling), Minimum-norm estimation, time-frequency, Minimum-norm estimation, Beamforming, spatial morphing, connectivity estimation, and statistics.
  
  -Contains methods to identify and reject artifcats, but it is mostly manual and involes use of the GUI
  
  -divides data into epochs using event timing. esentially its like cutting up the data into little segments that corrispond to similar tasks
  
  -Overall, MNE has may useful tools which we can pull from to help incorporate automagic into python.
