A large electroencephalographic motor imagery dataset 
for electroencephalographic brain computer interfaces

M. Kaya et al, 2018.


-Dataset containing a data collection during the 
development of slow cortical potential-based EEG BCI. 

-The dataset contains 60 hours of EEG recordings, 13 participants,
75 recording essions, 201 individual EEG BCI interaction session-segments,
and over 60, 000 examples of motor imageries in 4 interaction paradigms.

-The participants were all healthy volunteers students from 20-35 years old.

-EEG data were acquired using an EEG-1200 JE-921A EEG system.

-EEG data acquisition was performed with the help of a standard 10/20 EEG cap
with 19 bridge electrodes in the 10/20 international configuration.

-All data in the dataset were recorded in a synchronous BCI paradigm.

-The dataset consists of 75 data files each containing the complete data record
of one BCI recording session plus one text description file. Each recording session contains
approximately 55 min of recorded EEG data for 3 BCI interaction segments.

-All data files are shared in .mat format and contain MATLAB-readable records of the raw
EEG data and the recordings session's interaction record.

-A technical validation of the dataset was performed by building and examining all 
stimulus-locked average event-related potential (ERP) curves for all different types of
mental imageries.
