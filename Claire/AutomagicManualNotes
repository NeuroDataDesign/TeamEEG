Notes on Automagic User Manual
General
Workflow: 1)create project w/ configs and data, 2)Run preprocessing, 3) review and inspect bad channels and their effects, interpolate, 4) quality assessment
EEGlab is used — we’ll need to find replacement functions probs within MNE

How to Start
Function runAutomagic starts a GUI
Very specific data folder structure required, check documentation to see
Creating a new project needs:
	name of project
	file extension (five different functions used depending on the file type, so we’ll need to check this out and make sure we can do all of them)
	data folder
	results folder
	channel location file (must be supported by pop_chanedit function, there’s something weird with Electrical geodesics format)
	sampling rate
	reference channel if any
	any channels to exclude

Configurations
Bad channel detection
	PREP (Bigdely-Shamlo et al. 2015)
	clean_rawdata()
Filtering
	linepower
	high pass and low pass filters (both use eeg_filtnew()
Artifact removal
	can do EOG regression
	MARA: ICA and rejection, requires 10-20 ch label system
	robust PCA (Lin, Chen, and Ma 2010)
Quality Rating
	Overall thresholds
	Time thresholds
	Channel thresholds
	all of these are used for calculations about good/bad datasets
Interpolation
	eeg_interp()
All of this is selected in the GUI and then saved for all of the project, can’t really be changed
Load up these configs from another previous file by loading project_state.mat file

Quality Assessment
New GUI for this after preprocessing
Plot of all the data, marks the automatically detected bad channels, has all the stats on the side for how good the dataset is
Quality Rating GUI
	overall high amplitude ratio
	timepoints of high variance ratio
	channels of high variance ratio
	ratio of bad channels
	all of these then used, thresholds for each of them, to bin into Good, OK, and Bad datasets
Files get labeled with a quality rating at the end when committed, any change in quality rating adds another prefix so you can always see first commit

State Files
Project state file (project_state.mat) has all the info on the files in the project, configurations, everything; useful for debugging or loading configs
Main state file (state.mat) has info about your version of automatic

BIDS integration
Let’s worry about this later

Adding and Removing Data
Add or delete from finder and then refresh the main Automatic GUI
Can also merge projects by just copying data into new folders, but leaving out their project_state.mat files

Automagic as an EEGLab extension
We won’t worry about this

Using Automagic within the command line
Can start a new project with Project function
DefaultParameters.m used anywhere there is no inputted parameter
Public methods in Project.m , so you can do a lot once its made
	project.preprocesAll()
	project.interpolateSelected()
Specific template for parameters
Main preprocessing function preprocess.m
Default parameters used for my_param = struct() but a preprocessing step is skipped if you write struct([]), only way to skip
Default steps are PREP, MARA ICA and EOG regression

Standalone preprocessing code
preprocess.m main code, calls others
Needs an EEGlab input format?

Docker
I think I need to understand Docker before I can really understand this one
