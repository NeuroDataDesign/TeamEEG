BIDS
Overall idea of BIDS: make it easy for someone else to work on your data, share data, etc. - added benefit: you can use other people’s codes cause it’s all there for you! Thanks open source community
Dataset (out project), subject, session, data acquisition, data type, task, event
File name structure: YOU MUST USE THIS
	entities (key-value pairs)
	chain of entities, a suffix, connected by underscores, gives the filename
Source data -> raw data -> derived data
Inheritance -> any metadata defined at a higher part of the directory is inherited lower unless there is something else below that replaces it - key value pairs not in the deeper level one are inherited by the shallow one
	don’t define at the top if its more or less even, causing overrides
Any labels of subjects, sessions, etc. must only be letters and numbers 

EEG for BIDS
a .json file required to describe dataset
Metadata “eeg.json” will describe all experimental and recording details
Within EEG directory of each subject, an EEG file with naming convention
	also a .tsv file for the channels, also .tsv for electrodes and .json for coordsystem 
	events.tsv should be present
Formats of data supported: .edf, brainVision core data format, eeglab (.set and .fdt) and Biosemi (.bdf)
Definition: electrodes are points of contact, channels are data challenge (ref and ground are not channels)
Definition: anatomical landmarks are not fiducials , the latter are consistent points to reference coord system, anatomical landmarks can vary
Use MNE-BIDS!

MNE_BIDS
Codes here take care of all of the reading/loading in files, parsing the file name for the subject, sessions, task, etc.
Also functions to move data into BIDS, write the .tsv files, all you need to make the dataset, make the file names, everything
