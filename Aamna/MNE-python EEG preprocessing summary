MNE-Python’s preprocessing pipeline:

•	Importing data: The two most common formats of the files that MNE can load is Functional Imaging File (FIF) and European Data File (EDF). 
•	Filtering data: Notch filter (remove powerline contamination), high pass filter (remove slow drifts), low pass filter
•	Downsampling
•	Rejecting bad channels and channel interpolation:
      #	Perform averaging of the signal with artifact rejection algorithms like SSP (Signal Space Projection) and ICA (Independent Component Analysis).
      #	Visual inspection
      # Channel interpolation performed by spherical splines
•	Artifact correction:
      #	SSP
      # ICA
      # Maxwell filter (for removing artifacts caused by head movements)
