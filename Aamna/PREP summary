Summary of the Prep pipeline
•	PREP (preprocessing pipeline) was developed to perform early stage filtering of the EEG data in a standardized and automated manner.
•	It performs the following steps: 
# High-pass filtering - All frequencies above 1 Hz are passed. 
# Line noise removal – It uses the cleanline method from EEGLab. The EEG signal is transformed into the frequency domain. The amplitude and the phase of the noise signal is obtained using frequency-domain regression model. The amplitude is compared to a threshold and if it exceeds it then the sinusoid noise signal is reconstructed in the time domain. It is then subtracted from the EEG. 
# Referencing- robust referencing algorithm (working: not clear).
# Detection of noisy and outlier channels- It finds extreme amplitudes (deviation criterion), lack of correlation between channels (correlation criterion), lack of predictability by other channels (predictability criterion), high frequency noise (noisiness criterion). 
# Interpolation of bad channels- It uses the EEGLab function, eeg_interp() for applying spherical interpolation. 
•	It also generates a report of the dataset characteristics.
