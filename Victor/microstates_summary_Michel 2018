EEG microstates as a tool for studying the temporal dynamics of whole-brain neuronal networks: A review, Michel & Koenig, 2018, NeuroImage

Key Conclusions:
	1. Standard processing pipeline and objective quantifiers should be well defined for analyzing microstates.
	2. Defining the number of microstates:
		When comparing the "same" microstates between groups or conditions, optimal number of clusters should be defined in each dataset individually and global criteria should be used.
		When looking for microstates specific for a certain group or condition, the number should be defined independently for each group or condition.
		When comparing microstates between studies, to fix the number to four is justifiable yet leaves a good part of the data unexplained
	3. Basic assumptions of the EEG microstate model: Only one spatial map configuration entirely defines the relevant microstate of the brain at each moment(Winner-take-all)
	4. Transitions between states and scale-free dynamics of microstates time series may be explained by criticality of a dynamic system.
	5. A microstate is composed of a bundle of temporally overlapping and spatially synchronized oscillatory events that putatively originate from the same sources.
	6. Several studies have indicated that EEG microstates are closely associated with RSNs as defined using fMRI.

Important Questions to be solved:
	1. Computation of microstates and temporal descriptors
		What methods or pipelines should be used to define microstates?
		How to define the number of microstates in different studies?
	2. Does each microstate reflect a distinct conscious mental brain state(elementary building blocks of consciousness)?
	3. What are the brain sources underlying EEG microstates?
	4. What is the relationship between functional connectivity and EEG microstates?
