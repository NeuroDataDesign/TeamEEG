Motivation:
	Lack EEG measures for Large-scale studies(generalization) & Finding biomarkers
	Major challenges:
		1. Difficult to obtain EEG recordings with comparable quality between subjects
		2. Decision on quality metrics is highly subjective and depends on many factors.
		3. Lack software which allows handling og large, growing datasets.
		4. Need a principled format to organize, harmonize, and share data.
	Solutions/Highlights:
		1. Implement a selection of currently available artifact correction procedures
		2. Propose a novel quality metrics based on the quantification of the absolute signal strength
		3. Present Automagic Software to standardlize the above pipeline.
		4. Automagic handles growing studies and supports BIDS format.
	
About Automagic:
	A MATLAB based toolbox for preprocessing of EEG-datasets.
	Contains 3 parts: project section, configuration section and quality assessment section.
	Used by Command line/GUI
	Workflow:
		1. Create a project, define a date folder(source) and result folder(target), define configurations
		2. Import EEG data, preprocess(include bad channel identification and removal, artifact correction)
		3. Interpolation and quality assessment(classify datasets into 'good', 'OK' or 'bad'), export to BIDS format
		4. Output filtered EEG/EOG data, detected bad channels, etc., methods logfile
	Algorithms:
		1. Bad channel identification: PREP pipeline, EEGLAB plugin clean_rawdata()
		2. Artifact correction: EOG regression(EOGr), Multiple Artifact Rejection Algorithm (MARA), Noise removal using robust PCA (rPCA)
		3. Quality measures: Ratio of Bad Channels (RBC), Ratio of timepoints of high variance (THV), Ratio of channels of high variance (CHV)
	Validation: 
		1. Validate combining methods
		2. Assume neural activities(signals) are relatively stable, the similarity between EEG with and without artifacts should increase after preprocessing
		3. Calculate quality metrics
	Limitation: not sufficient data for validation
