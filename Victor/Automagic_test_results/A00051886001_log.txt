* PREP pipeline (Bigdely-Shamlo N, Mullen T, Kothe C, Su K-M and Robbins KA (2015))
	* Temporary (not affecting final EEG) detrend data at 1.00 Hz cutoff 
	 (0.02 s window slide) using using high pass detrending to improve 
	 performance of down-stream processing. In the case of high pass 
	 filtering the pop_eegfiltnew FIR filter is used.
	* Line noise removal, using routines from the cleanline EEGLAB plugin 
	 with a frequency range of [0.00 250.00] Hz, where 60 120 180 240 Hz 
	 (+- 2 Hz bandwith) are tried to be removed in maximally 10 iterations.

	* Detecting noisy or outlier channels based on extreme amplitudes 
	 of a Z-score cutoff for robust channel deviation of more than 5.00.
	* Detecting noisy or outlier channels based on lack of correlation 
	 with any other channel with a window size of 1 s to compute 
	 correlations and a threshold of 0.40 (the lowest maximum correlation 
	 with another channel).
	* Detecting noisy or outlier channels based on lack of predictability 
	 by other channels using a RANSAC sample size of 50 in a fraction of 
	 0.25 evaluation channels to predict a channel. Channels are bad if 
	 the RANSAC prediction in a fraction of 0.40 windows of 5.00s duration 
	 falls below the absolute correlation of 0.75.
	* Detecting noisy or outlier channels based on unusual high frequency 
	 noise using a Z-score cutoff for SNR (signal above 50* Hz) of 5.00.
	* Robust referencing using maximally 4.00.

* Removing a total of 10 noisy or outlier channels
	* Number of channels removed due to PREP: 10

* Remove the effect of EOG using linear analysis  (Parra, L. C., Spence, C. D., Gerson, A. D., & Sajda, P. (2005). Recipes for the linear analysis of EEG. Neuroimage, 28(2), 326-341.)

* Automatic classification and removal of artifactual source components using 
	 Multiple Artifact Rejection Algorithm (MARA) (Winkler, I., Haufe 
	 , S., & Tangermann, M. (2011). Automatic classification of artifactual 
	 ICA-components for artifact removal in EEG signals. Behavioral and 
	 Brain Functions, 7(1), 30.)
	* Performed a temporary (not affecting final data) high pass filter using 
	  pop_eegfiltnew() FIR filter  with passband edge(s): 1.00Hz, 
	 filter order: 1650.00, transition band width:  1.00Hz.
	* Run an ICA decomposition of an EEG dataset using the EEGLAB function 
	 runica(), removing 79, while retaining 16.88 	* Automatic classification of multiple artifact components based on 
	 6 features from the time domain, the frequency domain, and the pattern
	* Remove classified components and subtract their activities from the 
	 (not temporarily filtered) data

* Remove DC offset by subtracting the channel mean
