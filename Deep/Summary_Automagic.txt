AUTOMAGIC : Standardized preprocessing of big EEG data


-Aims to solve the problem of lack of software allowing to work with large as well as growing datasets.

-For ease of data sharing and integration, Automagic provides support to the BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) format as both input and output.

-focuses on standardization of the preprocessing and quality control.

-Structure & Workflow:
 Contains 3 basic sections:
 1. Project
     -defining the information of EEG data to be processed (such as format, channel locations, Input/Outpot folders etc.)
 2. Configuration
     -selection of preprocessing steps
 3. Quality assessment
     -review the quality of data

-Processing pipeline:
 raw EEG data -> Bad channel identification -> Bad channel removal -> Artifact correction -> Interpolation and Quality Assessment -> Quality classification -> Export

- Bad channel identification through PREP pipeline and clean_rawdata() EEGLAB plugin (latter being computationally cheaper and faster)

-uses EEGLAB's functions for filtering

-Artifact correction using EOG regression, MARA (ICA-based) and robust principal component analysis (rPCA).

-Quality assessment measures taken into consideration:
	-Ratio of Bad Channels (RBC)
	-Ratio of data with overall high amplitude (OHA)
	-Ratio of timepoints of high variance (THV)
	-Ratio of channels of high variance (CHV)

- Using any combination of these quality measures, data is classified as 'Good', 'OK' or 'Bad'.

-Validation done using 52 EEG datasets.
